So THIS IS IT 
(my big project)


started @ 10/07/2021 & 19:00 
(the client was impressed by my python skills & the deal was closed @ 27/06/2021)

the finishing line is @ 01/11/2021
(still waiting for a graphics designer)

HTML-CSS-JavaScript-PHP+MySql all will be written by me
(still stuck with a broblem that I have with my JavaScripting)

So the ReadMe File will be changed and improved accordingly

So far I learned 
a) Don't Underestimate your work
b) Don't Undervalue your work (1st official job that I've taken)
c) things will always be harder than they look
d) I was impressed with myself because I haven't written HTML & CSS from 2007 
e) & never an official one...only personal projects
f) The client will always ask more than what he/she is willing to pay
and lastly g) The amount of time that is been spend on this project is enormous

see you soon...
